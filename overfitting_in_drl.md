# A Study on Overfitting in Deep Reinforcement Learning

https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.06893.pdf

General goal in ML: prevent overfitting and optimize out-of-sample generalization.

3 contributions:
- Study generalization and memorization capabilities in RL agents on maze games. Find that agents end up memorizing many mazes.
- Evaluate standard techniques for tackling overfitting.
- Interpreting the different generalization behaviors of agents across environments from the lens of inductive biases.
